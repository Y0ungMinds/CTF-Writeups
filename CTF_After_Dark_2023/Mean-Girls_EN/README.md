This challenge has a login page and we need to hack(wow!). Let's view the source code.

There are two findings in there. One of it is login-page.css and login-page.js. Let's take a look at js.

Boom! We have credentials! But after we logged in. There are no flag or anything suspicious. Let's view the source again logging in.

Yay! We got the fla-...? What the heck is this? It is not the flag! Now I understand. They're talking about the caesar cipher! Now there are bunch of different websites to decrypt caesar. We will be using cyberchef.

We got the flag! Rotating 23 times was enough. So, that means if we shift all the characters to left 3 times, we can get our flag! (You can try! It's like magic!) Another 10 points comes to our team!
